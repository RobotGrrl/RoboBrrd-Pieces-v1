RoboBrrd Pieces v1

Here are all of the pieces (and their piece number) for creating your own RoboBrrd! You can use the .eps file to laser cut it out-- or even just print it out and cut it out of cardboard. Be sure to read the other included .txt files for additional information.

Designed by Erin Kennedy / RobotGrrl for RoboBrrd.com.
